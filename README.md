# FastAPI Division API - readme generated by ai :)

This project provides a simple FastAPI application that exposes an endpoint for performing division, along with a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The FastAPI application code.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the application.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the application.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the Dockerized FastAPI application.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the root directory of this project in your terminal and build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t fastapi-division-api .
```

This command builds a Docker image named `fastapi-division-api` based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name division-app fastapi-division-api
```

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 of your host machine to port 8000 inside the container, where the FastAPI application is running.
- `--name division-app`: Assigns a name to your container for easy reference.
- `fastapi-division-api`: The name of the Docker image to run.

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Test the API Endpoint

You can test the `/divide` endpoint using `curl` or any API client (e.g., Postman, Insomnia).

#### Successful Division

To perform a successful division (e.g., 10 / 2):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/divide \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"numerator": 10, "denominator": 2}'
```

Expected JSON response:

```json
{"result": 5.0}
```

#### Division by Zero Error

To test the division by zero error handling (e.g., 10 / 0):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/divide \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"numerator": 10, "denominator": 0}'
```

Expected JSON response with error:

```json
{"detail":"Division by zero is not permitted."}
```

### 4. Stop and Remove the Container (Optional)

If you want to stop and remove the running container:

```bash
docker stop division-app
docker rm division-app
